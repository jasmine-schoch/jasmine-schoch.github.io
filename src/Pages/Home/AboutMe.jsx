                        Hello hello welcome! I am Jasmine Schoch (pronouced "shock"), a student at the University of Washington pursuing a degree in computer science with a concentration in data science, a minor in applied mathematics, and a strong passion for biological research. Outside of school and research, I am a proud member of the Traditional Chinese Dance team at UW, performing solos and group dances across UW and the greater Seattle area to promote Chinese culture.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was born and raised in Northern Virginia in a house of avid readers and Disney lovers. I have two younger sisters,  and grew up with my Chinese grandparents. I love going to the beach in the summer, and skiing in the winter!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When taking a break you can find me lifting, reading, planning "family events" for my house of 8 girls, or crafting. I have recently picked my crochet hooks and knitting needles back up, and have created a long to-do list for myself to get some Christmas presents done in time!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am known by my friends for my inability to tell a linear story, and have a bubbly personality. I am very much a people person and always love interacting with new people, so please feel free to reach out!
