                        Hello hello welcome! I am Jasmine Schoch, a class of 2025 graduate from the University of Washington with a B.S. in computer science, and a strong passion for biological research. While in college, I was a proud member of the Traditional Chinese Dance team at UW, performing solos and group dances across UW and the greater Seattle area to promote Chinese culture.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was born and raised in Northern Virginia in a lively household of avid readers and Disney fans. I have two younger sisters, and I grew up alongside my Chinese grandparents. I loved my time in Seattle while I miss the PNW greatly, I'm happy to be back in the DMV area where I can visit my family more easily and cheer on my sisters whenever possible.                        
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Outside of work you can find me dancing, lifting, reading, or working on my latest hobby (currently it's learning how to play sax). I have always been one to have a packed schedule, and even after graduation it seems I always having something or another going on! Although these days, it seems that it's mostly spending my evenings at the dance studio.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am known by my friends for my inability to tell a linear story, and take pride in my bubbly personality. I am very much a people person and always love interacting with new people, so please feel free to reach out!
