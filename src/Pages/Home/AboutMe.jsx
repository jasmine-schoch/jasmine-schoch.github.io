                        Hello hello welcome! I am Jasmine Schoch (pronouced "shock"), a current student at the University of Washington pursuing a degree in computer science with a concentration in data science, a minor in applied mathematics, and a strong passion for biological research. Outside of school and research, I am a proud member of the Traditional Chinese Dance team at UW, performing solos and group dances across UW and the greater Seattle area to promote Chinese culture.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was born in raised in Northern Virginia (NoVa) in a house of avid readers and Disney lovers. Being (technically) from the South, I am spoiled by my beaches and have yet to visit one on the West Coast that meets my standards (although I have yet to visit SoCal).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When taking a break you can find me lifting, reading, planning "family events" for my housemates, or potentially hitting the slopes on my skis.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am known by my friends for my inability to tell a linear story, and have a bubbly personality. I am very much a people person and always love interacting with new people, so please feel free to reach out!
