                        Hello hello welcome! I am Jasmine Schoch (pronouced "shock"), a current student at the University of Washington pursuing a degree in computer science with a concentration in data science, a minor in applied mathematics, and a strong passion for biological research. Outside of school and research, I am a member of the Traditional Chinese Dance team at UW, and perform solos and in group dances across UW and Seattle to promote Chinese culture.

                        <br />
                        I was born in raised in Northern Virginia (NoVa) in a house of avid readers and Disney lovers. Being from the East Coast, we are big on going to the beach and even living in Seattle, I try to make it back for our annual beach trip every year!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In my freetime, I enjoy quality time with my friends and family, lifting, reading, and skiing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am known by my friends for my inability to tell a linear story, and for my bubbly personality. I am very much a people person and always love interacting with new people, so please feel free to reach out!
