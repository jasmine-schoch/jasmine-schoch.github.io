                    I wanted to make this website a little different from the typical CS kid glorified-digital-résumé-as-personal-website (no offense) by sharing more of my interests and personality, offering more insight into my life. The plan is to make this page into a blog and/or reflections page (inspired by the UW honors portfolio) but I've yet gotten around to coding it. In the meantime, checkout <a href="https://www.instagram.com/molihuacha.j/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="life-adventures--link">@molihuacha.j</a> on Instagram if you want to see what adventures I'm up to lately! (Spoiler alert, it's a lot of dance videos)
